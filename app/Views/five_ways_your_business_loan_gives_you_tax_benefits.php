                    Now, let’s break down how you can leverage these tax benefits while repaying your business loan.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-[#313030] text-[20px] font-semibold pb-2">1. Interest on Business Loans is Tax-Deductible</h4>
                    <p class="text-[#313030] text-[15px] font-light pb-3">
                    The biggest advantage of taking a business loan is that the interest you pay is tax-deductible. This means the interest amount is not considered as business profit, reducing your taxable income.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ps-5">
                        <li class="mb-2">Only the interest portion of your EMI qualifies for tax deductions.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">The principal repayment amount is not eligible for tax benefits.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">You can claim deductions under the Income Tax Act as part of business expenses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-[#313030] text-[15px] font-light pb-3">
                    This tax relief helps businesses reduce overall costs and manage finances efficiently.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-[#313030] text-[20px] font-semibold pb-2">2. A loan for Business Expenses? Get a Tax Benefit!</h4>
                    <p class="text-[#313030] text-[15px] font-light pb-3">
                    If you use your business loan for certain expenses, you can claim tax deductions. These include:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ps-5">
                        <li class="mb-2"><b>Purchasing Machinery or Equipment: </b> Deduct depreciation and interest costs.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><b>Renting or Buying Commercial Property: </b> Deduct loan interest as a business expense.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><b>Marketing and Advertising Costs: </b> If financed by a loan, these expenses qualify for tax deductions.</li>

                    As long as the loan is used for business-related purposes, you can claim tax benefits.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-[#313030] text-[20px] font-semibold pb-2">3. Business Loan Processing Fees Can Be Deducted</h4>
                    <p class="text-[#313030] text-[15px] font-light pb-3">
                    Did you know that loan processing charges and related fees can be deducted as business expenses?
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ps-5">
                        <li class="mb-2">Many lenders charge processing fees, legal fees, and service charges when approving a loan.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">These costs can be recorded as business expenses, reducing taxable income.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Ensure you maintain proper documentation to claim deductions correctly.</li>

                    Even small tax benefits like these add up over time, reducing your overall financial burden.

                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ps-5">
